# py-pkg-cookiecutter

A personalized Python package [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## System setup

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Update conda packages: `conda update --all`
3. Install cookie cutter: `conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter`
4. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

## Usage

Initialize the package:
```
cookiecutter https://github.com/clnsmth/py-pkg-cookiecutter.git
```

Create a conda environment for the package and activate:
```
conda create --name <pkg_name> python=<min_py_vers> -y
conda activate <pkg_name>
```

Add development dependencies:
```
# Frequently used
poetry add --group dev pytest pytest-cov sphinx sphinx-autoapi sphinx-rtd-theme myst-nb pylint black 

# Semantic release
poetry add --group dev python-semantic-release

# Notebooks
poetry add --group dev jupyter nbqa
```

Add other dependencies:
```
poetry add <dependency>
```

Git:
- Initialize the directory as a git repository.
- Create a development branch from main.

GitHub:
- Initialize a new repository for the project.
- Grant GitHub Actions write permissions to enable merge of releases back into the development branch, which prevents possible downstream merge conflicts. Select `Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions > Read and write permissions`.
- Push the local repository to the remote (make sure the development branch is pushed, otherwise the CD pipeline will fail).
- Pull Requests: [Disable merge commits](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-merging-for-pull-requests) to encourage a linear commit history.

Update "TODO" prompts in:
- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
