# Contributing to {{ cookiecutter.__package_slug }}

The goal of {{ cookiecutter.__package_slug }} is to ... We welcome community contributions to the work.

## Development and Release Process

The `main` branch always reflects the current stable release, a `development` branch is used for merging features, and `feature` branches create changes. Feature branches are named with the corresponding issue # and a short description (e.g., `30-release-workflow`). Once a feature passes review, it's commit history is squashed and commit title, following the Angular commit style, is added along with reference to the issue it closes. The feature is merged into `development`. `development` is reviewed before each release, and upon approval is merged into `main`. Merges to `main` kick-off a GitHub Action workflow in which Python Semantic Release bumps the version number, tags the release, and builds the changelog. Additionally, the workflow updates package documentation, creates a downloadable release on GitHub, and archives it with Zenodo.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as a standard Python package following the conventions outlined in the [Python Packges](https://py-pkgs.org/) guide.

## Git Commit Guidelines

This project uses Python Semantic Release to streamline the deployment process. As a consequence, the Angular commit style is required. For guidance, see: https://py-pkgs.org/07-releasing-versioning.html#automatic-version-bumping.

## Testing

Any new feature or bug-fix should include a unit-test demonstrating the change. Unit tests follow the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) framework with files in tests/. Please make sure that the testing suite passes before issuing a pull request. 

This package uses GitHub Actions continuous testing mechanism to ensure that the test suite is run on each pull request to `development` and `main`.

## Style and Formatting

This project uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for code formatting, [Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for static code analysis, and [NumPy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#style-guide) conventions for docstrings.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include additional tests if appropriate.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The pull request should be made to the `development` branch.
