# Release History

## Release Process and Guidelines

In our project, we adhere to the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) when it comes to our releases. By following this release process, we ensure the orderly progression of our project while maintaining compatibility and providing necessary bug fixes and improvements.

*Major Releases*: A major release introduces significant changes, including those that break compatibility with previous versions. These releases are identified with a version number in the format of `X.0.0`. For instance, if the previous release was `1.2.7`, the next major version will be labeled as `2.0.0`.

*Minor Releases*: A minor release does not include breaking changes and primarily focuses on bug fixes and improvements. If the previous version of {{ cookiecutter.__package_slug }} was `1.2.7`, a minor release would be denoted as `1.3.0`.

*Patch Releases*: A patch release exclusively addresses any missed bugs from the previous version. If the previous release of {{ cookiecutter.__package_slug }} was `1.2.7`, a patch release would be identified as `1.2.8`.
